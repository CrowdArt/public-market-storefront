        <h1><strong>Welcome to Public Market</strong></h1>
        <p>
          We know that commerce should be <b>for the people</b>. That’s why we’re building a truly peer-to-peer marketplace ー without middlemen taking a cut. Thanks for joining our mission to replace the broken, monopolistic marketplaces of today with a fair, universal, and completely free one for the future.
          <br><br>
          By buying and selling on Public Market, you play a pivotal role in ensuring the complete decentralization of eCommerce by 2030, today.
